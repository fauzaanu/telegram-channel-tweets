# A Simple twitter bot to copy telegram channel updates to twitter automated account

made for https://twitter.com/Paradoxsignals

the cred_sample.py is a sample file for the twitter and telegram credentials. It should be renamed to cred.py after replacing with your credentials.

Had a lot of problems using the majority of twitter automation scripts created in the past so this is made as a skeleton to start over for new projects.

Essential access as they call it right now which doesnt include waiting for any periods to be approved for twitter developer is enough for this

The aproach Ive used is OAuth2

This is hosted on digital ocean
The telegram bot is added as an admin to the channel that is being copied
